# Remove assignment for previous version of an app
# Intune App Factory should keep track of what apps it has packaged in e.g. a storage table:
# - For each packaged and published app, store the app name, id, version and assignment group
# - Enumerate all previous versions to see which still exist in Intune and have an assignment
